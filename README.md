# The database

Vera will create a `.db` file on first boot named `vera_logs.db`, This is where Veras AI model is stored.

An existing database can be used just by copying it to the Vera directory and making sure it is called `vera_logs.db`.

Our pre-trained model is available on [our discord server.](https://discord.gg/jeXnXqH)

# Image support

To make Vera a more successful shitposter we added support for vera to randomly chose an image to send if one is sent to him, he also has a random chance of sending an image in response to a message.
